# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-for-Sustainable-Agriculture

🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

📌 Overview:

Plant diseases can severely impact crop yields, leading to economic losses for farmers. This project aims to develop an AI-powered plant disease detection system using deep learning. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the system can classify whether a plant is healthy or infected with a specific disease.

🛠️ How It Works:

Image Processing: The system preprocesses images of plant leaves by resizing, normalizing, and enhancing them.
Deep Learning Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on labeled images to classify plant diseases accurately.
Prediction & Output: Users can upload an image, and the model will provide a diagnosis along with the disease name and confidence score.
Web-Based Application (Optional): A simple web interface allows farmers or researchers to upload images for disease detection.

🎯 Applications:

✅ Agriculture & Farming: Helps farmers detect plant diseases early to prevent crop loss.

✅ Research & Development: Useful for agricultural scientists studying plant health.

✅ Mobile & IoT Integration: Can be extended to mobile applications or IoT-based monitoring systems.

📊 Expected Outcome:

A trained model that can classify plant diseases with high accuracy.
A simple Python-based prediction script to detect diseases from images.
Optionally, a web interface for easy usage.

This project bridges the gap between technology and agriculture, providing a smart solution to improve crop health monitoring. 🌱🔍
